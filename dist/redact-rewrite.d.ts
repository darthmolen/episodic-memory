/**
 * Backfill for `episodic-memory redact --rewrite`: re-run redaction over data
 * written before redaction existed (or before a rule was added).
 *
 * 1. Archive: every .jsonl is redacted in place. Line count and mtime are
 *    preserved, so index line ranges stay valid and sync still sees the
 *    archive as current.
 * 2. Staging dirs (opencode / legacy Cursor exports): same, in place.
 * 3. Index: every exchanges/tool_calls row is redacted in place. Changed rows
 *    are re-embedded from the redacted text, so no vector is left that was
 *    derived from a secret.
 * 4. Summaries: a `-summary.txt` for a conversation that had findings (in the
 *    archive or the index), or one that matches a rule itself, is deleted.
 *    It was generated from unredacted text, and the next sync regenerates it
 *    from the redacted archive.
 *
 * Idempotent: a second run finds nothing to change.
